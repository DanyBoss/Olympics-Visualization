## About
This is a web visualization of Olympic data from 1896 until 2012. 
It currrently only features data from the Summer Olympics, but adding data from Winter Olympics is planned for the future.

This visualization was initially developed as a project for the Masters Course Information Visualization at Lisbon TÃ©cnico but turned into sort of a hobby of mine.

## Usage
Here's a quick rundown on how things work around here.

The main focus in this vizualization is the number of **Olympic Medals** won (unless  stated otherwise like in the *Scatterplot*) and comparing this number by several factors.

The visualization is split into 5 parts, the *Time Slider*, *World Map*, *Bubble Chart*, *Scatterplot* and finally *Line Chart*. 
Only 3 of these serve as filters and those are the *Time Slider* for selecting the Time Interval, the *World Map* for selecting countries and finally the *Bubble Chart* for selecting specific events/disciplines.
The other 2 serve for analyzing information with the filter provided.

## Credits
This visualization is made using HTML5, JS with help of [D3.js](https://d3js.org/) and [JQuery](https://jquery.com/)
