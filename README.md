## About
This is a web visualization of Olympic data from 1896 until 2012. 
It currrently only features data from the Summer Olympics, but adding data from Winter Olympics is planned for the future.

This visualization was initially developed as a project for the Masters Course Information Visualization at Lisbon TÃ©cnico but turned into sort of a hobby of mine.

## Credits
This visualization is made using HTML5, JS with help of [D3.js](https://d3js.org/) and [JQuery](https://jquery.com/)
