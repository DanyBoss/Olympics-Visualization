## About
Olympics Visualization is a web visualization of Olympic data from 1896 until 2012. It currrently only featured data from the Summer Olympics, but adding data from Winter Olympics is planned for the future.

This visualization was initially made as a project for the Information Visualization course at Lisbon TÃ©cnico but turned kind of into a hobby of mine.

## Credits
This visualization is only made thanks to [D3.js](https://d3js.org/) and [JQuery](https://jquery.com/)
